# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Description

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered "unsinkable" RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there werenâ€™t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

This project aims to build a predictive model that answers the question: "What sorts of people were more likely to survive?" using passenger data such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.

## Instalation

<li>Clone the repository</li>

```
git clone https://github.com/PedroRibaldo/Titanic_Prediction.git
cd Titanic_Survival_Prediction
```

## Usage

<li>Run the 'Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb' script to train and evaluate the predictive model</li>
<li>The script uses various machine learning models such as SVC, KNN, and Random Forest, along with genetic algorithms for feature selection.</li>
